Daily Scheduler

This project allows a user to enter events into different time slots. When the user clicks the save button, the event(s) are stored into localStorage. The text areas will change to different colors depending on the current time, which is located at the top of the page (grey = past, green = present, blue = future). When the page is refreshed, the events will stay in the scheduler. There is a clear schedule button on the bottom of the page that will allow the user to clear the local storage and refresh the page to it's default (blank text areas).

This project was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
